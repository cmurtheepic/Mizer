<p>The purpose of this App is to help People practice their basic and complex math problem(s) through generating a problem, and displaying it to the User. Where the User then selects a answer from a set of 9 different supplied answer(s). through random selection the correct answer is shown on 1 of the 9 button(s) (selection(s)) and the rest are filled with incorrect answer(s). The selection is comprised of one correct answer, 1 or 2 trick question(s), 1 or 3 impossible answer(s), and maybe some negative answer(s) depending on the type of problem the application has generated for the User to solve. Whether it be; Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division problem(s), or Other*** problem(s). The Application gets the User(s) desired Difficulty for the Math problem(s) by having them select a number of (By Default) 1-10. but if the User desires a difficulty of greater than 1-10, then they may enter the desired difficulty for the math operations they wish to practice. For each of the Math Operation Problem(s) of course. Though you may also practice; Algebra, Geometry, and Calculus**</p>
